<h2>Conditions of Use</h2>
<p>Lafuma furniture is solely intended for personal and leisure use. Lafuma accepts no responsibility, nor does it provide the benefits of the limited warranty, if a Lafuma chair is used for business or commercial purposes.</p>
<p>To ensure that the chair is used correctly and safely, it must be set up and used as directed in the included instructions.</p>
<p>Lafuma products are designed and manufactured for normal use as a chair, which implies that it should be used for the weight for which it is rated it is designed and excludes, among other things, use by two people at the same time, even for a short period or leaning on it partially.</p>
<p>Individuals should sit down in the chair without "falling" into it, and should change position without making any sudden movements.</p>
<p>If chairs are to be used by children, they should be supervised by adults. Lafuma products are not trampolines. </p>
<p>The Lafuma chair should be maintained regularly. Lafuma elastic lacing cords should be replaced when they show signs of wear, especially in the area at the front of the seat, and at least every 2 years. The metal joints should be lubricated with a dry silicone or an equivalent product.</p>
